Exposure to PM 2.5 pollution increases the risk of lung cancer, stroke, heart attack and respiratory diseases, including asthma symptoms among all age groups. Among the top 30 most polluted cities, India makes up for 22 with five in China, two in Pakistan and one in Bangladesh. The Indian government, which has faced scrutiny over high levels of air pollution for years, continues to try to combat the problem with little success based on this most recent study. There have been many attempts to limit air pollution in cities across India such as heavy truck bans, reducing construction projects at certain times of the year and shutting down power plants. 36 Bills passed: Modi 2’s most productive Parliamentary Session The Modi-2 government, in its first session after the 2019 elections, passed landmark bills like repealing of Article 370, geographical reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir, Triple Tal aq Bill, new Motor Vehicle Amendment Bill, etc. The parliament created the record for maximum Bills passed in the last 67 years.

Global economy on the brink Lately, the world economy has slowed down to its lowest pace in three years. Global trade and investment have been weaker than expected at the start of 2019. The main reasons impacting the global economy is the escalating US-China',\n",
              " 'trade war, Brexit uncertainty, EU-US trade disputes, and rising debt levels. As a result, both the World Bank and the IMF have downgraded their global growth forecast from 3.3% to 3.2%, and from 2.9% to 2.6% respectively. Many world economies are on the verge of recession, raising uncertainties that a global economic slowdown could contract the U.S. economy as well. Most of these countries have a common problem: they are deeply reliant on exports of goods. This is not a great time to have an export-driven economy. Already, China posted the worst industrial output in 17 years and the German economy shrank in Q2. As the economic slowdown increases, there aren’t many rescue hands to help. Thus, investors are escaping to the usual havens: Government Bonds and Gold. A number of central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve, South Korea, Indonesia, Ukraine, and South Africa are cutting interest rates to spur economic growth. Besides, China allowed the Yuan to weaken past 7 Yuan to 1 U.S. Dollar to promote its exports. Even in India, the things are not in great shape either. Moody’s has lowered India’s economic growth forecast to 5.8 percent from the earlier estimate of 6.2 percent thanks to lack of demand, weak liquidity, and tepid consumer spending. In all, the IMF believes that 90% of the countries across the globe will witness slower economic expansion in 2019.

Though in North India, air has been exceptionally clean in recent weeks because of the extended monsoon and strong wind, but these conditions soon reversed. Drying up of northern India further deteriorated Delhi’s air. The withdrawal of the monsoon, expected this week after a month’s delay, was another threat to northern India’s air quality because of the formation of anticyclonic conditions in the atmosphere, which are associated with clear skies and very calm wind conditions.

The BJP sealed its phenomenal electoral victory, crushing the Opposition by winning over 300 votes. Modi’s transformation over the past year from a regional, right-wing politician to a decisive leader with a clear development agenda, the one best suited to take India forward is nothing short of extraordinary. The archetype he offers is of a strong, all-knowing father figure who is unwavering. To create the father figure, Modi’s team invoked tales of childhood, in books and comics. Invariably, and understandably, they were tales of heroism involving a precocious Bal Narendra (Modi as a child). Modi’s ability to become taller than his party lies in his symbolism. He tapped into despair, hopelessness and sinking feelings, and arrived on the scene taking on the symbolism of the outlaw and the ruler combined. He is perceived as an icon of disruption and rebellion against the way things are done. It is this counter-cultural streak that appeals to youth who desire change. And his traits like being organised, proactive, and confident, and in command of things, subtly connect with the ruler archetype.

After cancelling the initial launch of the Chandrayaan-2 lunar mission last week, India‘s 2nd launch attempt seemed to be a success. The lunar lander was expected to travel through space for the next six weeks before attempting to land on the Moon’s surface in September. If successful, India would have become the fourth country to land a vehicle intact on the lunar surface. The said probe made some significant discoveries. For example, it confirmed the existence of water ice on the Moon’s south pole. And to do this, the spacecraft must land on the Moon in one piece and should remain alive on the surface for the length of a full lunar day. That’s 14 days on Earth. After touching down on the lunar surface, the lander and rover would study the area near the landing site for two weeks. Using a suite of onboard instruments, they’d try to understand more about the composition of the surface.

According to defence experts, Rafale will boost India’s air dominance exponentially. The French word Rafale means andhi in Hindi or gust of wind. With India having strained relations with its neighbours, the induction of the Rafale fighter jet will be a ‘game changer’ for India in regional geopolitics of South Asia. The combat jet will be seen in Indian skies only in May 2020. Rafale, categorised as a 4.5 generation aircraft for its radar-evading stealth profile, is a twin-jet fighter aircraft capable of operating from both an aircraft carrier and a shore base. India had ordered 36 Rafale fighter jets in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016. The manufacturers describe it as a fully versatile aircraft, which can carry out all combat aviation missions to achieve air superiority and air defence, close air support, in-depth strikes, reconnaissance, anti-ship strikes and nuclear deterrence.India becomes only the fourth country, after France, Egypt and Qatar, to fly the Rafale. Pakistan has the multi-role F-16 in its inventory and it may only be compared with India’s Mirage 2000. Hence, Pakistan doesn’t have anything equivalent to the Rafale. However, any comparison with the air power of China still has a long way to go.

Month by Month Analysis 2019CA-51 With the purpose of identifying the Indian citizens in the state of Assam, a register containing all the names of genuine Indian citizens was prepared in 1951, which is called the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The NRC is a list of people who have legally earned the confirmation of being Indian citizens with the supporting evidence that they came to India before 24 March 1971. This day is marked as a landmark because before this day, India’s neighbouring country Bangladesh was declared independent from Pakistan. NRC became a tool to control unabated migration from Bangladesh. It will form the basis for detecting illegal migrants and people included in this list will be provided protection against harassment and also enjoy all constitutional rights and safeguards and will also be benefitted by government schemes. The updating process has been initiated in the year 2013 under strict monitoring and supervision of the Supreme Court of India and it ended on 31 August 2015. Through 68.31 lakh applications, around 3.29 crore people were included in the verification process. For registration in the NRC, the eligibility entails such persons whose names appear in the list of 1951 and have their names appear in',\n",
              " 'any of the electoral rolls up to March 24, 1971. Descendants of such persons also fall in the list. Other than these, such persons who came from another region on or after January 1, 1966 but before March 25, 1971 and got them registered with the Foreigners Registration Regional Officer and were declared as Indian citizens by the Foreigner Tribunal also are held eligible. Updating of the data of the legal citizens began in the 1980s in Assam due to the feeling of alienation amongst the natives in the state. So, the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) and Assam Gana Parishad submitted a memorandum seeking the demand of updating the list and also to preserve the indigenous culture of Assam from illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Those citizens of Assam who prove their residency in the state on or before March 21 , 1971 will be counted in the updated list. Impact on India’s ties with neighbours As per the la test list published in August this year, around 2 million people have been excluded from the list and they are posed to the threat of statelessness. It is still not clear where will such huge number of immigrants be given shelter. The irregular flow from Assam to Bangladesh can lead to additional distress and there is probability of Bangladesh perceiving it negatively. The present ties between India and Bangladesh are tilted towards shared interests and growth. However, with NRC issue raising a speculated uncertainty regarding the settlement of the non-citizens,',\n",
              " 'Bangladesh cannot be given any benefit of doubt to point fingers towards India. India already is putting forward its clever steps while talking about river water sharing, border infiltration, trade, technology and other economical ties with Bangladesh. Amidst all such healthy talks and positive bonding, any casual handling of the NRC issue and non-citizens may trigger Bangladesh’s anguish against India. Thus, the current situation demands for making a wise diplomatic concession that does not hurt the sentiments of India’s neighbourhood, nor does it invite unwanted attention from the i nternational arena. Domestic and international implications The voice of creation of a separate NRC list is being raised in Nagaland as well and soon the turmoil may spread to other states. This might leave many more stateless and add to the millions w ho have been excluded currently in Assam. As the biggest problem points towards the battle that these excluded people will have to fight in the foreigners’ tribunals; a series of litigations follow as another botheration for them. Most of those excluded are poor, daily wage earners, with little or no literacy and legal knowledge. This makes their problem worse and condition even more deteriorating. While majority of those who did not make it to the list still have their family members in the list, concerns are raised regarding the procedural transparency as well. The whole process of updating the list and filtering of the migrants is itself a lengthy, time-taking one; involving people from government jobs doing their',\n",
              " 'roles and no additional officials are hired for the same. This hinders the day-to-day functioning of the concerned government NRC Issue and its impacts on India’s ties with its neighboursNRC Issue and its impacts on India’s ties with its neighboursMonth by Manth Analysis 2019CA-52 offices and thus creates more room for disorder and mismanagement. Uncertainty looms large over the already stateless people and additional calls for updating the NRC list in other states may create a huge mess for the country as a whole. International bodies and human rights commissions may raise their concerns and India can be seen in a bad light over the pretext of human rights. While the basic dignity of the weak, voiceless and vulnerable is at stake, the exploitation of the situation by some vested groups might open up a new dimension in the regional identity politics. India and Bangladesh do not have a deportation treaty and so it will never accept the deported persons without checking their integrity with their records. The present government has given a boost to the Act East policy of India and so there is a need for political stability in the north east as the region is crucial for investments and engaging trade and commerce. Another issue is that most of the tribal population in the state register themselves with tribal identity and not as Assamese. The campaign to update the NRC has upset everyone and the challenges of being faced by legal recourse post exclusion, will face objections',\n",
              " 'and highlighting by the international community. The NRC process has also provided the political fuel to push the demand for The Citizenship Amendment Bill, which seeks for allowing minority Hindus, Christians, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists except Muslims from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. This can have dangerous consequences as it fundamentally remakes citizenship in India. Tens of thousands of Bengali Muslims have been hit the worst. Bangladesh has already accepted 10 lakh Rohingyas as a humanitarian gesture and accepting anyone from Assam would be seen as a surrender to India. China may play foul in distorting relations between India and its neighbours and thus it is required that the matter which started as an internal call, should stay internal and a sovereign matter of India. The problem requires an analytical and not compromising solution. It asks for resolution of the situation through diplomatic assessment rather than treating it as an opportunity to play vote politics by regional and national parties.

India should be prepared diplomatically, economically, socially and geographically to sustain the immigrants in case of no final solution to those who are rendered stat eless and homeless.Month by Month Analysis 2019CA-53 Who can forget the great financial crisis of 2008, which pushed the world into an economic slowdown? But the Indian economy remained largely unscathed, and the reason behind this was the robustness of the baking sector in India. At that time, both the Indian economy and the Indian banking sector were regarded as a shining beacon during global turmoil. Now, fast-forward 10 years, and the situation of Indian banking system is utterly disappointing. The banking sector in India is plagued by issues like corruption, rising NPAs, lack of supervision, poor accounting practices, and capital inadequacy which have resulted in lowering of the popular sentiments. Numerous banking frauds and scams have been unearthed in the last few years by the investigation agencies, highlighting the rot at the core of the Indian banking system. Instances like Kingfisher Airlines fraud, Nirav Modi- PNB fraud, PMC Bank fraud are just a tip of the iceberg; the problem runs much deeper. As a matter of fact, in the year 2009, India had the lowest NPA ratio amongst the G-20 economies @ 2.280. But as of 2018, it has amongst the highest NPA ratio amongst the elite G-20 group @ 11.180. Why such a surge in the NPAs? Well, it would be a folly to think that the',\n",
              " 'sudden surge in the NPAs is a recent phenomenon. The problems run deeper and dates to well before 2009. The investigation has proven that the lowest NPA ratio in 2009 was due to a toxic combination of poor accounting practices and regulatory laxity. As a result, banks managed to understate their NPAs and hid the true extent of the problem. Another reason attributed behind this development is that after much prodding from the Reserve Bank of India, the banks finally relented and recognised these bad assets which were otherwise being hidden in the annual reports. When the banks started reporting the true extent of the NPAs, the ratio just skyrocketed from an all-time low of 2.250 in 2011 to 11.180 in 2018. While NPAs are a common problem plaguing the global banking networks, but the situation looks grim in the Indian context due to the problem of capital inadequacy with Indian banks. Having a healthy capital adequacy ratio is essential for any bank as it signifies its ability to withstand contingent financial losses on account of risky assets. But despite having a conservative loan to deposit ratio, Indian banks fare poorly on this front. Moreover, the saga of NPAs does not seem to have reached its conclusion yet. New revelations are being made regularly which indicate that all of the NPAs have not yet been accounted for. For instance, in its reports filed in 2018, SBI reported unexpected losses of 2,416 crores due to surge in bad loans. Though the',\n",
              " 'bank says that the worse is over, but it has been saying this since 2010, so one can not be sure if the saga is finally over or there are still some portions left to be unravelled. Causes of rising NPAs in India There are various loopholes in the Indian banking system that has given rise to the problem of NPAs, such as: - Defective lending process: The lending process of every commercial bank should be based on three principles, safety, profitability, and liquidity. But due to vested interests as well as corruption, more often than not decision-makers at banks tend to ignore these principles. Moreover, lack of transparency in the lending process also makes it difficult to appropriate the responsibility of decision-makers in case of defaults. India’s rising NPAs, loopholes in banking system & measures to curb them.Month by Manth Analysis 2019CA-54 High leverage: When the Indian economy was on an upward trajectory in the mid-2000s, banks offered loans to corporations based only on the recent performance, rather than assessing the historical financial data. As a result, corporations grew highly leveraged. All money for the expansion of business operations was being sourced through banks instead of promoter’s equity. When the global financial crisis manifested in 2008, the corporations started facing difficulty in making the repayments. As a result, both the banking sector and corporate sector of the economy came under tremendous stress. Evergreening: In order to hide the problem of NPAs, banks started offering loans to corporations to allow',\n",
              " 'them to repay their interest liabilities for previous loans. This trend further worsened the problem and was equivalent to “brushing it under the carpet.” When the problem of NPAs was finally recognized, the situation had gone from bad to worse. Frauds: The fact which makes the problem of NPAs even worse is that the bank employees were colluding with the borrowers. Rules were flouted, information was suppressed, and procedures were ignored to offer loans to select corporates. For instance, in the case of the recent PMC Bank fraud, more than 70% of the bank’s loans were provided to a single entity, which is a gross violation of RBIs guidelines. Wilful defaulters: Due to lax recovery efforts and prolonged legal process, even those borrowers who are in a position to repay their loans are refraining from making the payments. Lack of monitoring: Banks do not undertake regular visits to the premises of the borrowers to monitor the progress of the work as well as to press for the recovery of the dues. Most of the times, bank officials are obliged by way of gifts by the borrowers, and they, as a result, do not put pressure for recovery of the dues. How to reduce the NPAs? The government and RBI have taken several steps to stem this rot, and they have started showing results as well. These me asures can be classified as: - Regulatory measures: Policy level decisions like the introduction of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 provide for',\n",
              " 'a 180-day recovery process for NPAs. As of March 2018, 701 cases have been registered under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and more than 170 cases have already been resolved. Remedial Measures: RBI has been recommending remedial measures for banks in the form of guidelines to help with the restructuring of NPAs. Strategic debt restructuring and joint lenders forum are the key initiatives under the remedial measures which have been offering good results. Apart from these measures taken by the Government and the RBI, certain changes must also be incorporated by the banks on a personal level to stem this rot. Here are some steps that the banks can take to curb the menace of bad loans: - One time settlement: Banks need to offer an opportunity to defaulters to settle their outstanding dues through a one-time settlement. Herein, the borrower needs to pay a lump-sum amount in lieu of the outstanding dues. Usually, the banks let go of the accumulated interest and penal charges and settle the account against repayment of outstanding principal. Transparency: Banks need to incorporate strict and transparent eligibility criteria to screen the applications of loans. If any borrowers have defaulted in repayments or are facing trouble in making the payments, their applications must be carefully scrutinized.

By removing human involvement from the loan disbursal process, the prejudices can be effectively negated. Dedicated recovery department:',\n",
              " 'Banks need to have dedicated recovery departments to follow-up with the defaulting customers and make regular visits to recover the outstanding amounts. With the potential to wreak havoc on the country’s economy, NPAs must be dealt with on a priority basis.

        "Answer: The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, introduced in 1919, aimed to increase Indian participation in governance. They included provisions for the introduction of a bicameral legislature at the provincial level, with a majority of members elected by the Indian electorate. The reforms also introduced the concept of dyarchy, where certain subjects were transferred to Indian ministers while others remained under British control. Though these reforms fell short of Indian demands for complete self-rule, they represented a significant step towards greater autonomy and paved the way for further constitutional developments.\n",

        "Query: What were the causes of the Revolt of 1857?\n",
        "Answer: The Revolt of 1857, also known as the First War of Independence, was caused by a combination of political, economic, social, and religious factors. Key grievances included the introduction of the Enfield rifle, which required soldiers to bite off the ends of cartridges greased with animal fat, offending both Hindu and Muslim soldiers. Economic issues, such as land revenue policies and the imposition of high taxes, also fueled resentment among Indian sepoys and civilians. Social and religious factors, including the perceived threat to Indian customs and traditions, further contributed to the discontent that led to the revolt.\n",
        "\\nExample 3:\n",
        "Query: What were the main objectives of the Non-Cooperation Movement?\n",
        "Answer: The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920, aimed to achieve swaraj (self-rule) and protest against British colonial rule through nonviolent means. Its main objectives included boycotting British institutions, such as schools, courts, and government services, and promoting indigenous goods over imported ones. The movement sought to mobilize the masses in a nonviolent struggle for independence and promote Indian self-reliance. Despite its suspension in 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident, the Non-Cooperation Movement left a lasting impact on India's struggle for independence.\n",
